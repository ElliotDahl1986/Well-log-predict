# Well-log-predict
Random forrest/SVM

A project where I try to classify facies in well logs using ML algorthims. 
Data in this notebook comes from the following [website](http://www.people.ku.edu/~gbohling/EECS833/).

The dependent variable is rock facies, while the dependent variables are gamma ray (GR), resistivity logging (ILD_log10), photoelectric effect (PE), neutron-density porosity difference and average neutron-density porosity (DeltaPHI and PHIND). There are two geologic constraining variables: nonmarine-marine indicator (NM_M) and relative position (RELPOS).
